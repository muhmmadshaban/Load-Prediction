## Project Overview
This project is a Loan Application Prediction system that predicts whether a loan will be granted based on user inputs. The model is trained using various features collected from the user, and it provides a prediction based on these inputs.

## Model Description
The model is trained by **Pulkit Goyal** using a Voting Classifier that combines multiple algorithms to improve prediction accuracy. The model takes into account various factors such as:

- Gender  
- Marital Status  
- Number of Dependents  
- Education Level  
- Employment Status  
- Applicant Income  
- Coapplicant Income  
- Loan Amount  
- Loan Amount Term  
- Credit History  
- Property Area  

## Frontend Development
The frontend of the application is developed by **Naman** and **Nandini**. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their loan application details. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Backend Development
The backend is developed using **Flask**, a lightweight web framework for Python. It handles the logic for processing user inputs and making predictions using the trained model.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git https://github.com/muhmmadshaban/Loan-Prediction.git
   cd Loan-Prediction
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the application.
